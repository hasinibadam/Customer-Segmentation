Used K-Means clustering to group customers based on similar purchasing behavior.

Applied PCA to reduce dimensions and visualize clusters effectively.

Performed data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, normalization).

Found optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.

Helped identify target customer groups for better marketing strategies.
